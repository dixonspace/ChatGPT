The author is an entrepreneur who over the past 30 years has set up and grown several different businesses, however, for the last 15 of these years, he has also lectured in the field of entrepreneurship and enterprise for 1 day per week. As an experienced practitioner in his field, he has been able to directly engage and inspire learners within his subject area, however he has never had any formal educational training on the underpinning academic theories of learning. Hence his enrolment on the “Post Graduate certificate in Higher Education and Learning” of which an “Introduction to Learning, Teaching and Assessment (ILTA)”, is the first module. 40608255791200 Figure 10 Figure 1402907582550040735251694180The approach throughout ILTA has been disruptive. In the very first session, the learners were challenged to make Lego models of how they currently visualised themselves as teaching professionals. Subsequently, they had to produce an aspirational model, showing the visualisation upon completion of the unit. Figure 1 depicts the authors initial model, a lone Indiana Jones type figure guiding the metaphorical learning experience down the theoretical river of wisdom. Figure 2 visualises the new tools and skills that the educator would now have onboard his raft to assist in this journey. 40735257444330 Figure 2 Figure 2Although superficially having the appearance of playing when you should be learning, there is a significant body of work underpinning the use of Lego in a wide range of learning settings. Bushnell (2009) utilises Lego to facilitate the teaching of Japanese as a foreign language. Atmatzidou, Markelis and Demetriadis (2008) investigate Lego’s uses in triggering learning in elementary and secondary education. In Higher Education Nerantzi and Despard (2014) look at the potential for using lego to develop Postgraduate Academic Practice. The primary experience of the author as a participant in a session based on the underlying work of Nerantzi and Despard (2014), can certainly testify as to its effectiveness and longevity. Visualisation of one’s own pedagogical preferences facilitates both personal development and a desire to continuously evolve as an educational professional. It is within this context that the author, an experienced entrepreneurial practitioner, would meet the disruptive challenge of ILTA and all the academic learning principals and theory which underline the course. 2.0Reflection 2.1Evaluation and Selection of Reflective Model Four different reflective models were considered for the purposes of this assignment. The Reflective Cycle, Gibbs (1988); The Experimental Learning Cycle, Kolb (1984) and The Six Thinking Hats, De Bono (1985). 28765505588000Gibbs’s (1988) six stage Reflective Cycle guides the user through a series of 6 distinct stages. This structured and logical approach ensures all aspects of the experience are described, analysed and considered throughout the reflective process. Although Gibbs originally promoted it’s use for repeated situations, it work’s equally well for single experiences too. 49765326198534 The Reflective Cycle, Gibbs (1988)00 The Reflective Cycle, Gibbs (1988) It is both straightforward and simple to use and therefore a good approach for reflecting upon new experiences for the first time. Arguably, it is one of the most famous models of reflection and is widely used by both students and academics a like. Kolb’s (1984) Experimental Learning Cycle, pre-dates Gibbs work and indeed influenced Gibbs in the development of his six-stage cycle. The concept divides the learning process into a cycle of four basic theoretical components: concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation. The cycle can begin at any of the four points. 011430Kolb stated that learning involves the acquisition of abstract concepts that can be applied flexibly in a range of situations. In Kolb’s theory, the impetus for the development of new concepts is provided by new experiences. -23812503181350 Experimental Learning Cycle, Kolb (1984)00 Experimental Learning Cycle, Kolb (1984)“Learning is the process whereby knowledge is created through the transformation of experience” (Kolb, 1984, p. 38). De Bono (1985) uses a metaphor of thinking hats to reflect and evaluate experiences and problem
